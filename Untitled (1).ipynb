    "--> Statistics can be broadly categorized into two types: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and describing data in a meaningful way. It provides an overview of the main characteristics of a dataset. Some common measures used in descriptive statistics include mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, and percentiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's say you have a dataset containing the ages of students in a class. Descriptive statistics can be used to calculate the average age (mean), the middle value (median), or the most frequently occurring age (mode) to gain insights into the typical age distribution of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "Inferential statistics involves drawing conclusions or making predictions about a larger population based on a sample of data. It uses probability theory to make inferences, estimate parameters, test hypotheses, and determine the significance of relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose you want to know the average height of all adult males in a country. Instead of measuring the height of every male in the country, you can collect a sample of heights from a representative group and use inferential statistics to estimate the average height of the entire population with a certain level of confidence."

    "--> Data can be classified into four main types: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Nominal Data:\n",
    "Nominal data represents categories or labels with no inherent order or numerical value. It consists of discrete and mutually exclusive categories. Nominal data can only be categorized or counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Colors of cars in a parking lot (red, blue, green) or types of animals (cat, dog, bird) are examples of nominal data. You can count the number of cars of each color or the number of animals of each type, but you cannot perform mathematical operations like addition or subtraction on the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Ordinal Data:\n",
    "Ordinal data represents categories with a natural order or ranking. The difference between categories is not precisely quantifiable, but the relative order is meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Educational attainment levels (elementary school, high school, bachelor's degree, master's degree) or customer satisfaction ratings (very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied) are examples of ordinal data. You can determine the order or rank of the categories, but the numerical difference between them may not be uniform or measurable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Interval Data:\n",
    "Interval data represents measurements with equal intervals between values, but it does not have a true zero point. The zero value does not indicate the absence of the attribute being measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Temperatures measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit are examples of interval data. The difference between 10 and 20 degrees is the same as the difference between 30 and 40 degrees, but a temperature of 0 degrees does not mean there is no heat. In interval data, addition, subtraction, and averaging operations can be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Ratio Data:\n",
    "Ratio data represents measurements with equal intervals between values and has a true zero point, which indicates the absence of the attribute being measured. Ratio data allows for the most precise mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Height, weight, age, and income are examples of ratio data. A height of 0 means no height, a weight of 0 means no weight, and an income of 0 means no income. Ratio data allows for all mathematical operations, including multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, and finding ratios."

    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "1. Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset. It is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the total number of values. The mean provides a measure of the central value and represents the typical or average value of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when arranged in ascending or descending order. It divides the dataset into two equal halves. The median is not influenced by extreme values and provides a measure of the central value that is robust to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. It represents the most common value or category. The mode is useful for categorical or discrete data and can provide insights into the most prevalent category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "1. Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a measure of the spread or dispersion of the dataset. However, the range is sensitive to outliers and does not consider the distribution of the data between the extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It quantifies the spread of the dataset by considering the differences between each value and the mean. A higher variance indicates greater variability in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the average distance between each data point and the mean. The standard deviation is widely used and provides a more intuitive measure of spread than variance."
